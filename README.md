# News-classification-using-LSTM-with-Attention

- Dataset - https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/texas-amanda-painter-mass-shooting_us_5b081ab4e4b0802d69caad89
- Prepared the dataset, feature engineering, data cleaning, cleaning, tokenizing the data, padding.
- Used glove embedding (transfer learning) https://nlp.stanford.edu/projects/glove/
- Dataset splitting, Training Text CNN. Investigating overfitting, underfitting.
- Further used Bidirectional GRU with Convolution, Obtained higher accuracy.
- Used LSTM with Attention model, predictions with Attention model, confusion matrix
- Evaluating accuracy, Applied ensemble learning.
